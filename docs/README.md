# Website

The THNK website and docs are built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Contributing

Contributing is simple and welcome! Just submit a PR with your changes.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Display the website with local changes

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens it up in a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Creating pages

Creating and editing pages is as simple as editing markdown files in the `docs` folder. To create a new page, simply make an empty text file, rename it to end in .md, and start writing!
